Scientific consensus explains that the sky appears blue due to the physical phenomenon of Rayleigh scattering within Earth's atmosphere.","claims":[{"id":"c1-fdfae76a","text":"The sky is blue.","verdict":"TRUE","explanation":"The sky appears blue because of Rayleigh scattering. When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it is scattered in all directions by gas molecules. Blue light travels in shorter, smaller waves and is scattered more intensely than other colors, making it the dominant color we see.","sources":[{"domain":"nasa.gov","title":"Why Is the Sky Blue? | NASA Space Place","url":"https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/blue-sky/en/"},{"domain":"weather.gov","title":"Why Is The Sky Blue? - National Weather Service","url":"https://www.weather.gov/jetstream/color"}]}],"timestamp":"2026-02-06T21:03:29.019127Z","inputPreview":"The sky is blue."}
